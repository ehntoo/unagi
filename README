Please refer to INSTALL file concerning installation instructions.

At the  moment, only Awesome  Window Manager has been  heavily tested,
but it should work properly with any Window Manager following EWMH and
ICCCM specifications.

Once you have  built the program, you can run it  by simply typing the
following command:

$ unagi

It  will look  for  a configuration  file  in `$sysconfigdir/xdg'  (by
default  `/usr/local/etc/xdg'), then  fallback on  the paths  given in
`XDG_CONFIG_DIRS' (as specified in `XDG Base Directory Specification')
if it cannot find it. You can also specified the configuration file by
passing `-c' option.

You may  find the program  documentation in doc/ directory  in various
format (HTML, LaTeX and man pages).

You  can  also  run  it  without installing  anything  by  typing  the
following command from the source directory:

$ ./src/unagi  -r rendering/.libs/ -p plugins/.libs/ -c unagi.conf

Xephyr
======

You may  want to use Xephyr (nested  X server) as the  software is not
really stable (yet):

$ Xephyr -screen 1024x768 -ac -br :1

Then  run  the  command  given  in  the  previous  section  by  adding
DISPLAY=:1 at the beginning. You  may want to run other X applications
(such  as Awesome  window manager)  by setting  DISPLAY=:1 environment
variable before.
