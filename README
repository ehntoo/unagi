Please refer to INSTALL file concerning installation instructions.

At the  moment, only Awesome  Window Manager has been  heavily tested,
but it should work properly with any Window Manager following EWMH and
ICCCM specifications.

Once you have  built the program, you can run it  by simply typing the
following command:

$ unagi

If the  program cannot  find the configuration  file, you have  to set
`XDG_CONFIG_DIRS'  environment  variable  to  the  configuration  file
directory. For example,  if you install it in  `/usr/local/', you have
to run the following command:

$ XDG_CONFIG_DIRS=/usr/local/etc/xdg unagi

You may  find the program  documentation in doc/ directory  in various
format (HTML, LaTeX and man pages).

You  can  also  run  it  without installing  anything  by  typing  the
following command from the source directory:

$ ./src/unagi  -r rendering/.libs/ -p plugins/.libs/ -c unagi.conf

Xephyr
======

You may  want to use Xephyr (nested  X server) as the  software is not
really stable (yet):

$ Xephyr -screen 1024x768 -ac -br :1

Then  run  the  command  given  in  the  previous  section  by  adding
DISPLAY=:1 at the beginning. You  may want to run other X applications
(such  as Awesome  window manager)  by setting  DISPLAY=:1 environment
variable before.
