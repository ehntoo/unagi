/** \file
 *  \brief Opacity effect plugin
 *
 *  This  plugin handles windows  opacity.  It  relies on  a structure
 *  containing,  for   each  mapped  (or   viewable)  'window_t',  its
 *  'opacity' and 'cookie', namely 'opacity_window_t'.
 *
 *  The  cookie  is the  GetProperty  request  sent  on MapNotify  and
 *  PropertyNotify events  and whose reply  is only got  when actually
 *  getting the window opacity (this  allows to take full advantage of
 *  XCB asynchronous model)
